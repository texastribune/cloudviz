# About cloudviz
This package exposes Amazon CloudWatch as a data source for Google Chart Tools.  With it, you can quickly generate graphs like this:

Cloudviz is proudly sponsored by [Bizo](http://bizo.com).  For details on the cloudviz's origin, see this [blog post](http://dev.bizo.com/2010/03/introducing-cloudviz.html).

If you're looking for easiest way to start graphing CloudWatch data, check out [Cloudgrapher](http://www.cloudgrapher.com).  Cloudgrapher is a free CloudWatch dashboard, and is effectively a hosted, batteries-included extension of cloudviz.

## Getting started
1. Familiarize yourself with:
   * [Amazon CloudWatch](http://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/) ([docs](http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/DeveloperGuide/))
   * [Google Visualization API](http://code.google.com/apis/visualization/interactive_charts.html) ([docs](http://code.google.com/apis/visualization/documentation/using_overview.html))
2. Download and install:
   * [boto](http://code.google.com/p/boto/) - a Python interface for Amazon Web Services
   * [gviz_api](http://code.google.com/p/google-visualization-python/) - a Python library for creating Google Visualization API data sources
   * [pytz](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pytz/) - world timezone definitions
3. Set **AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID **and **AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY **in <code>settings.py</code>
4. Make <code>cloudviz.py</code> web-accessible using your favorite HTTP server

# Using cloudviz
cloudviz expects the following query parameters as a JSON-encoded string passed to a qs parameter.  Default values for each parameter may be set in <code>settings.py</code>:

* `namespace` (str) - CloudWatch namespace (e.g., _"AWS/ELB"_)
* `metric` (str) - CloudWatch metric (e.g., _"Latency"_)
* `unit` (str) - CloudWatch unit (e.g., _"Seconds"_)
* `statistics` (list of str) - CloudWatch statistics (e.g., _["Average","Maximum"]_)
* `dimensions` (dict of str) - CloudWatch dimensions (e.g., _{"LoadBalancerName": "example-lb"}_)
* `end_time` (date) - end time for queried interval (e.g., _new Date_)
* `start_time` (date) - start time for queried interval (e.g., _start_time.setDate(end_time.getDate-3)_)
* `range` (int) - desired time range, in hours, for queried interval (e.g., _24_).  Note: `range` may be substituted for `start_time`, `end_time`, or both:
  * if `range` and `end_time` are specified, `start_time` is calculated as ( `end_time` - `range` )
  * if `range` and `start_time` are specified, `end_time` is calculated as ( `start_time` + `range` )
  * if only `range` is specified, `end_time` is set to the current time and `start_time` is calculated as ( current time - `range` )
* `period` (int) - (optional) CloudWatch period (e.g., _120_).  Notes: must be a multiple of 60; if `period` is not specified, it will be automatically calculated as the smallest valid value (resulting in the most data points being returned) for the queried interval.
* `region` (str) - (optional) AWS region (e.g., _"us-west-1"_; default is "us-east-1")
* `calc_rate` (bool) - (optional) when set to _True_ and `statistics` includes _"Sum"_, cloudviz converts _Sum_ values to per-second _Rate_ values by dividing _Sum_ by seconds in `period` (e.g., for _RequestCount_, 150 Requests per period / 60 seconds per period = 2.5 Requests per second)
* `cloudwatch_queries` (list of dict) - encapsulates each CloudWatch query, allowing for multiple queries to be graphed in a single chart.  Minimally, `cloudwatch_queries` must contain one dict with prefix defined.  Optionally, any of the above parameters may also be defined inside one or more `cloudwatch_queries`
  * `prefix` (str) - text identifier for data returned by a single CloudWatch query. This is prepended to the chart label of each data series (e.g., _"My LB "_)

### Example: Graphing CPU utilization of two instances
Here's a JavaScript snippet for building a URL to pass to cloudviz.  See examples/host-cpu.html for the rest of the code.  Note that **start_time **and **end_time **are set in <code>settings.py</code>.

    var qa = {
                "namespace": "AWS/EC2",       // CloudWatch namespace (string
                "metric": "CPUUtilization",   // CloudWatch metric (string)
                "unit": "Percent",            // CloudWatch unit (string)
                "statistics": ["Average","Maximum"],      // CloudWatch statistics (list of strings)
                "period": 600,                // CloudWatch period (int)
                "cloudwatch_queries":         // (list of dictionaries)
                [
                    {
                        "prefix": "Instance 1 CPU ",   // label prefix for associated data sets (string)
                        "dimensions": { "InstanceId": "i-bd14d3d5"} // CloudWatch dimensions (dictionary)
                    },
                    {
                        "prefix": "Instance 2 CPU "
                        "dimensions": { "InstanceId": "i-c514d3ad"}
                    }
                ]
             };

    var qs = JSON.stringify(qa);
    var url = 'http://' + window.location.host + '/cloudviz?qs=' + qs;  // assumes cloudviz.py is called at /data

The resulting URL should look something like this:
     http://localhost:8080/cloudviz?qs={%22namespace%22:%22AWS/EC2%22,%22metric%22:%22CPUUtilization%22,%22unit%22:%22Percent%22,%22statistics%22:[%22Average%22,%22Maximum%22],%22period%22:600,%22cloudwatch_queries%22:[{%22prefix%22:%22Instance%201%20CPU%20%22,%22dimensions%22:{%22InstanceId%22:%22i-bd14d3d5%22}},{%22prefix%22:%22Instance%202%20CPU%20%22,%22dimensions%22:{%22InstanceId%22:%22i-c514d3ad%22}}]}&tqx=reqId%3A0

And the graph, when passed through Google's Visualization API:
